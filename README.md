SchoolProjects
==============

A bunch of interesting school projects that I completed at [The Cooper Union](www.cooper.edu).  

**Operating Systems** has a bunch of C programs written to explore GNU/Linux fundamentals.  

**Data Structures and Algorithms** has some C++ programs implementing a Hashtable, Heap, Dijkstra's Algorithm, Stacks, and Queues.  

**Software Engineering** an online version of [Set](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(game)) created entirely in Java (https://github.com/elieweintraub/GroupSetGame).  

**Computer Architecture** contains a Matrix calculator written in MIPS assembly.
